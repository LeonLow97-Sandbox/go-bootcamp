// The Dining Philosophers problem is well known in computer science classes.
// Five philosophers, numbered from 0 through 4, live in a house where the table
// is laid for them; each philosopher has their own place at the table.
// Their only difficulty - besides those of philosophy - is that the dish
// served is a very difficult kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with
// 2 forks. There are 2 forks next to each plate, so that presents no difficulty.
// As a consequence, however, this means that no 2 neighbors may be eating simultaneously
// since there are 5 philosophers and 5 forks.

// This is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's solution to the "Dining
// Philosophers" dilemma.

// Philosopher is a struct which stores information about a philosopher

	name      string
