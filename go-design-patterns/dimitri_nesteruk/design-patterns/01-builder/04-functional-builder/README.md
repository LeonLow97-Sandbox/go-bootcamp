# Functional Builder

The functional builder pattern is an extension of the traditional builder pattern. It focuses on using functions (or closures) to construct an object step by step, allowing for more flexibility and composability in how the object is built.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Actions (`personMod` functions) can be added in any order, enabling different combinations and sequences of object construction steps.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new construction steps (such as additional fields or validations) is straightforward by defining new methods or modifying existing ones.
- **Encapsulation**: The construction process (`PersonBuilder` and `personMod` functions) is encapsulated, separating it from the final object representation (`Person` struct).

## Use Cases

- **Complex Initialization**: Useful when object initialization involves multiple steps or complex logic.
- **Conditional Construction**: Allows condition inclusion of fields or behaviors based on certain conditions, enhancing the flexibility of object creation.

## Comparison with Traditional Builder Pattern

- Traditional Builder: Typically involves a fluent interface with methods directly setting fields. May be less flexible for complex initialization sequences
- Functional Builder: Offers greater flexibility to compose and sequence actions dynamically, suitable for scenarios requiring conditional or varied object construction.

## Summary

The functional builder pattern shown in the provided Go code exemplifies a powerful approach to construct objects incrementally and flexibly. By using closures (`personMod` functions) to encapsulate construction actions, it enhances the readability, maintainability, and extensibility of object construction logic, making it a valuable pattern in software design.
